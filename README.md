# generating_cat_model
This model is designed to generate images of a cat. Each time it receives a 50-component vector of Gaussian noise as input, it produces a unique, adorable cat image as output. While it may not be highly practical for real-world applications, it serves as an excellent learning tool for students exploring the fundamentals of generative models.
